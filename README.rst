Praat scripts
=============

A collection of Praat scripts that I wrote a long time ago. I haven't updated 
them in a long time but perhaps they are still useful to some.


Usage
-----

In Praat ( download at https://http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/ ), open script 
and run. Many have some form of documentation included.
